This is a reposetory dedicated for results of analyses performed on generative models implemented into immuneML. 
All folders, except Datasets and k-mer_freq_comparisons contain the results of an execution performed in immuneML, along with corresponding YAML specifications

The Datasets folder contains all datasets used to run analyses.

The k-mer_freq_comparisons folder contains images of the resulting runs of the k-mer frequencey comparison execution, with a yaml specification for running the analysis. However, since the data produced from this analsis is so large, it is omitted from the GitHub.
